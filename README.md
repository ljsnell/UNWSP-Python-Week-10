# UNWSP-Python-Week-10

Instructions:
Program # 1:
Pick one of the short programs in one of the videos.  Compile and run that code.   

Program # 2: Car Class
Write a class named Car that has the following data attributes:

__year_model (for the car's year model)
__make (for the make of the car)
__speed (for the car's current speed)
The Car class should have an __init__ method that accepts the car's year model and make as arguments.  These values should be assigned to the object's __year_model and __make data attributes.  It should also assign 0 to the __speed data attribute.

The class should also have the following methods:

The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed data attribute each time it it called.
The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed data attribute each time it is called.
The get_speed method should return the current speed.
Next, design a program that creates a Car object then calls the accelerate method five times.  After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it.  The call the brake method.  After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.

Flow Chart Employee Class #3:
Draw flow charts for both the class and the mainline of the following program.

Program #4 Employee Class:
Write a class Employee that holds the following data about an employee in attributes: name, ID number, department, and job title.

Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data.

Name	ID Number	Department	Job Title
Susan Meyers	47899 	Accounting	Vice President
Mark Jones	39119	IT	Programmer
Joy Rogers	81774	Manufacturing	Engineer
The program should store the data in the three objects, then display the data for each employee on the screen.
